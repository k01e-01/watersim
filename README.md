# watersim

a cellular automaton based water simulator

but, it can be more realistically described as an unholy abomination, a child of 5 days of caffeinated brainstorming and my pure spaghetti code 

saying it barely works is an overstatement

## compiling

built on nightly rust because benchmarks :3

good luck o7
